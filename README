Make a ~/.stocks as CSV with columns

    symbol,num_shares,purchase_price

For example:

    ibm,50,47.06
    aapl,2,5.00
    vti,10.5,50.00
    # bought a second round for cheaper
    vti,20,45.00
    cash,123.45,1
    # brokerage transaction fees
    fee,4,9.99

And run like:

    ./tinystocks.py

Output will look like
